# Binary tree #

- A binary tree is a tree in which each node can have at most two children.

## Level ##

- The nodes in a binary tree are organized into levels with the root node at level 0, its children at level 1, the children of level one nodes are at level 2, and so on.

## Depth ##

- The depth of a node is its distance from the root, with distance being the number of levels that separate the two. A node's depth corresponds to the level it occupies.

## Height ##

- The height of a binary tree is the number of levels in the tree.

## Width ##

- The width of a binary tree is the number of nodes on the level containing the most nodes.

## Size ##

- The size of a binary tree is simply the number of nodes in the tree.
